Class
	tnbLib::functionEntries::includeEtcEntry

Description
	Specify an etc file to include when reading dictionaries, expects a
	single string to follow.

	Searches for files from user/group/shipped directories.
	The search scheme allows for version-specific and
	version-independent files using the following hierarchy:
	- \b user settings:
	  - ~/.OpenFOAM/\<VERSION\>
	  - ~/.OpenFOAM/
	- \b group (site) settings (when $WM_PROJECT_SITE is set):
	  - $WM_PROJECT_SITE/\<VERSION\>/etc/
	  - $WM_PROJECT_SITE/etc/
	- \b group (site) settings (when $WM_PROJECT_SITE is not set):
	  - $WM_PROJECT_INST_DIR/site/\<VERSION\>/etc/
	  - $WM_PROJECT_INST_DIR/site/etc/
	- \b other (shipped) settings:
	  - $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/

	An example of the \c \#includeEtc directive:
	\verbatim
		#includeEtc "etcFile"
	\endverbatim

	The usual expansion of environment variables and other constructs is
	retained.
